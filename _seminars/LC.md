Title: Set theory and the Continuum Hypothesis
Abstract: In a 2021 Annals paper, D. Aspero and the speaker showed that two prominent axioms of set theory which were introduced independently 
from one another in the late 80's early 90's and which both decide the size of the continuum are compatible, in fact one implies the other.
Both axioms are so-called forcing axioms which are also exploited in other areas of mathematics. I am going to provide an accessible
introduction to our result.
