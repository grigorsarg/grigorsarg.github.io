Title: Strong forcing axioms and the continuum problem <br>
ABSTRACT: A topological approach to forcing axioms considers them as strong forms of the Baire category theorem; an algebraic approach describes certain properties of "algebraic closure" for the universe of sets that can be derived from them. The goal of the talk is to outline the link betwen the geometric and algebraic points of view. <br>

The talk is meant for a general mathematical audience. In particular familiarity with logic or set theory is not assumed.</li><br>

Title: Set theory and the Continuum Hypothesis<br>
Abstract: In a 2021 Annals paper, D. Aspero and the speaker showed that two prominent axioms of set theory which were introduced independently 
from one another in the late 80's early 90's and which both decide the size of the continuum are compatible, in fact one implies the other.
Both axioms are so-called forcing axioms which are also exploited in other areas of mathematics. I am going to provide an accessible
introduction to our result.</li>
