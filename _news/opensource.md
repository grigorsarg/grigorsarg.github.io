I started using open-source and/or independent alternatives. So far the experiment is going well, but it is hard to go around Android. At any rate, for what it's worth, instead of Google Search, I use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/&kp=1">DuckDuckGo<a/>, instead of What's Up I use <a href="https://signal.org/#signal">signal<a/> and have moved away from Windows/Mac ecosystems to Linux distros. <a href="https://fedoraproject.org">Fedora<a/>, 
<a href="https://www.opensuse.org">OpenSuse<a/> and <a href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro<a/> are great alterantives to both Windows and Mac, but there are many more fun distros.

There is always going to be some hypocrisy behind the slogan "only open source.". GitHub is owned by Microsoft (for example). But supporting independent movements will only make the world a better place. Unfortunately, the only marketing strategy that open-source alternatives use these days is privacy, which seems to be something that a few care about (I cannot imagine that those who use Facebook or Instagram or YouTube Shorts or TikTok particularly care about open source). But, as the recent US elections show, by using only big tech software (not so much the hardware, unless it's Mac), we simply give them too much power in areas where they should not have any power.
