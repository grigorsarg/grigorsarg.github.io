***

Please consider using open source and independent alternatives. For example, instead of Google Search you may use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/&kp=1">Duck Duck Go<a/>, instead of whats' up 
maybe <a href="https://signal.org/#signal">signal<a/> and instead of traditional Windows/Mac maybe Linux distros. <a href="https://fedoraproject.org">Fedora<a/> or <a href="https://www.opensuse.org">OpenSuse<a/>,
<a href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro<a/> are very good alterantives to both Windows and Mac.
