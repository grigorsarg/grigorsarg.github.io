I started using mopen source and independent alterantives. So far the experiement is going well, but it is hard to go around android. At any rate, for what is worth, instead of Google Search I use
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/&kp=1">Duck Duck Go<a/>, instead of whats' up I started using
<a href="https://signal.org/#signal">signal<a/> and have moved away from Windows/Mac ecosystems to Linux distros. <a href="https://fedoraproject.org">Fedora<a/>, 
<a href="https://www.opensuse.org">OpenSuse<a/> and
<a href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro<a/> are great alterantives to both Windows and Mac, but there are many more fun distros.
