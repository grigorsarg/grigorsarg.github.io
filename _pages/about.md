Currently, I am a Professor IMPAN at the Institute of Mathematics of Polish Academy of Sciences. Before this, I was an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Rutgers University.

<font size="+2">Research:</font> My research is mostly in set theory, and within set theory, I am interested in inner model theory and its connections with forcing axioms and determinacy axioms.
