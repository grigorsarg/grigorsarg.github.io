I am a Professor IMPAN at the <a href="https://www.impan.pl/en">Institute of Mathematics of Polish Academy of Sciences<a/>.

I use <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch<a/>, btw. You should be too!

<font size="+2">Research:</font> My research is mostly in set theory, and within set theory, I am interested in inner model theory and its connections with forcing axioms and determinacy axioms.
