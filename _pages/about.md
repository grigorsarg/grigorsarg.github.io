Currently, I am a Professor IMPAN at the Institute of Mathematics of Polish Academy of Sciences. Before this, I was an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Rutgers University.

I am also the elected President of the Talking Chipmunk's Society. As the President of this society, I do absolutely nothing, which is why I very much like my title. The society gives a prestigious prize named after Alvin, the Alvin Prize, for the best Chipmunk Song of the year. The motto of the society is:

I think
Well our society is run by
Insane people
For insane objectives
Run by maniacs
For a maniacal ends
How and what
They think they're doing
I'd be very pleased to know
What they think they're doing
I think they're all insane

(words by Gizmo Varillas)
